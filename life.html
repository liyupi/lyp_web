				<p>
					Histories make men wise poets witty, the mathematics subtile, science makes people profound, moral grave, logic and rhetoric able to contend, where to study, there is a character. Yes, learning is so useful. Why should I hate it? Everything that we learn will have a great effect on our life in the future. From then on, I was full of confidence in my study life, and realized the fun of learning from it. When I fell in love with my studies, I found that my study enriched my every day life. But when I lacked it, I felt that I had nothing to do. When I learn a knowledge point or solve a difficult problem, there is a great sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in my mind. It is an unspoken pleasure to absorb and explore knowledge every day. Learning brings inspiration; learning brings wisdom; learning gives us wealth; learning gives us strength.
